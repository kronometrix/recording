## General

Kronometrix has been designed to _reduce_ the number of metrics collected from ICT, environment or meteorology to
IoT equipment by conducting a _carefully_ selection and analysis of what is required and how these metrics and parameters should be used. We are working closely with experts from each industry we support, to analyse these aspects from data collection, to summary statistics and visualization. Thats why we call our technology _deep domain expertise_ software.

All collected metrics and parameters are defined under our [library of monitoring objects](https://github.com/sparvu/lmo), an open source library, which keeps track of what is being monitored, what statistics are built and for what scope. This library plays an important role to Kronometrix to ensure we record, analyse and process what matters most.


## Raw Data
All recorded observations are stored as raw data. Raw data is produced by a _recorder_, which fetches data from a 
system, device or sensor, data which has not been modified, altered or changed in any way. All collected metrics 
are variable measured sequentially in time, called _time series_. All these observations collected over fixed sampling 
intervals create a _historical time series_. To easy the access to all this set of data we store the observations 
on commodity disk drives, compressed, in text format, like CSV format.

_Time series let us understand what has happened in past and look in the future, using various statistical models_


## Data Message
All collected metrics over time are combined as a data message. There can be many types of data messages: metrics regarding computer system utilization cpu or memory utilization, or weather data from a meteorological station, or water cubic meters per hour from an water pump. A data message is in direct relation to a data source. To describe one or many data messages, we have built a library of monitoring objects, (LMO) documented here: [library of monitoring objects](https://github.com/sparvu/lmo)


## Data Source
A data source, is described as any system connected to a public or private network with a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address. Example: a server, a logger, a graphic workstation, an iPad or an IoT sensor capable to send and receive data. There can be many types of data sources, each having one or many of data messages:

 * Computer system: overall cpu utilization, disk and network IO, per device metrics (Linux, FreeBSD, Windows)
 
 * HTTP server: throughput and utilization along with its inventory data (Nginx, Apache, Tomcat)
 
 * Enterprise service: response time performance and availability (SMTPS, IMAP, HTTP, LDAP, NTP, AD)
 
 * Automatic weather station: air temperature and pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction 


## The recorder
A light probe developed in _Perl5_ language which can extract data from different sources, like an operating system interfaces, a sensor or device, an industrial equipment using _MODBUS_ protocol, or an web based application or database.

The recorder can operate in two modes:

  * interactive: you can manually run the recorders using different samping rate values to analyse raw data
  
  * automatic: you can continuously record data, using a default sampling rate of _60 seconds_ or a custom one
